# Section 2

## Contract Deployment
* Contract source code
    * Solidity compiler
        * ABI
        * Contract bytecode
            * Deployed to network (Rinkeby or mainnet for example)
* Truffle
    * Command line tool that aids in contract creation, local testing and deployment
    * Useful but in constant development
* Custom Node project as alternative to Truffle
    * Allows us to create contracts, test locally and deploy to a specified network
